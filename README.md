# **DLight**

## Domain Driven Design Microframework

### About

****DLight**** (»_Delight_«) is a PHP microframework on top of [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) with a focus on a clean, object oriented software architecure and related design patterns.

**DLights** architecture adheres to the principles of [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). The main purpose of the the framework is to study software design patterns and web technologies in the master programme '[Digital Methods in the Humanities and Cultural Sciences](https://www.digitale-methodik.uni-mainz.de/)'.

At the same time, **DLight** and its [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) framework base make it possible to write clean and efficient APIs and HTTP-based web apps. 

**DLight** is in an early beta stadium at the moment - fully usable and already used in production but not feature complete. Most notably at this stage are **DLights** domain, factory and mapper classes that make coupling and transforming XML content (e.g. from an [eXist XML database](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html)) a breeze.

**DLight** still expects you to write your own PHP code ;-) It simply provides you with a clean architectural base for the task.
